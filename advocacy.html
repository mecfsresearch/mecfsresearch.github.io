				<h2>Advocacy for ME/CFS Scientific Research</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					Scientific research for ME/CFS diagnosis, pathomechanisms, and treatment
					is needed urgently! This disease has been marginalized and largely ignored by
					science at best and at worst, has been co-opted by a psychiatric lobby who have
					attempted to convince the medical, scientific, and patient communities
					that ME/CS is a psychological condition treatable with therapy such as CBT,
					when innumerable evidence has proven otherwise.
				</p>

				<h2>History of the British Psychiatric School's view of ME/CFS</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					Throughout its history, one of the biggest ringleaders promoting the psychogenic
					view of ME/CFS is UK Professor Simon Wessely, who invented a "false illness beliefs"
					model that attempts to frame the disease as merely a belief that one is sick, and
					changing that person's belief will make them well. Margaret Williams has written
					a discussion of the history of Simon Wessely's involvement in ME/CFS research.
					A copy can be found <a href="2025 - Williams - Wessely.pdf">here</a>.

				<h2>Editor's Comment</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					Two studies, Chang 2012 and Levine 1998, associated ME/CFS with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
				</p>
				<p class="passage">
					Chang 2012 associated
					ME/CFS with an increased incidence of NHL in older patients. The NHL subtypes
					were all B cell lymphomas, specifically, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and unspecified B cell NHL.
					They did not find increased risk of any other cancer
					types in ME/CFS patients after statistical controls. The increased lymphoma risk
					held even after adjusting for the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases in ME/CFS.
					Chang 2012 also identified increased rates of rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome
					in CFS.
				</p>
				<p class="passage">
					Levine 1998 found an increased incidence of NHL and brain cancer in areas where CFS outbreaks
					ocurred in the 1980s. (Since
					the brain cancer finding has not been replicated, it is not included in the list above.) The 1998
					study conflicted with earlier studies by the same authors which found no increased rate
					of cancer. The 1998 study was more granular than the earlier negative studies, by comparing
					counties where the 1980s outbreak of CFS occurred, instead of comparing statewide rates.
				</p>
				<p class="passage">
					The fact that NHL is associated with ME/CFS in two different studies, 14 years apart, using very different methodology,
					is striking. NHL is often associated with autoimmune diseases. Lymphoma is also associated with certain
					infections, most commonly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The Epstein-Barr virus was originally discovered in a
					patient with Burkitt's lymphoma, a type of B-cell NHL. EBV preferentially infects and establishes
					latency in B cells.
				</p>
				<p class="passage">
					Additionally, Dr. Dan Peterson, who treated patients suffering from an outbreak of CFS in Incline Village, NV has seen
					high rates of mantle cell lymphoma in his patients
					(<a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2010-05-21-the-trouble-with-me-no-end-to-a-tiring-debate/">1</a>,
					<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/13/me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome">2</a>,
					<a href="http://www.cfscentral.com/2014/05/candid-conversation-with-dr-ian-lipkin.html">3</a>).
					Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell NHL.

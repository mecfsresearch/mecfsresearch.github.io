				<h4><u>For ME/CFS</u></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>"Pathomechanisms and possible interventions in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)"<br>
						<i>J Clin Invest.</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci150377">Fluge 2021</a>)
						<ul>
							<li>
							Summary: The authors suggest three principal steps underlie the initiation and maintenance of ME/CFS.
							First, an immune response after infection serves as a triggering event, with a role for B cells/plasma cells and autoantibodies.
							Second, the autoantibodies target the vascular system and possibly GPCRs, which may affect endothelium or neurovascular control and autonomic small nerve fibers.
							This causes endothelial dysfunction in large and small arteries, impaired venous return and preload failure, and arteriovenous shunting, presumed to result in impaired autoregulation of blood flow and tissue hypoxia on exertion.
							Finally, compensatory efforts may add to the clinical presentations with autonomic adaptations, often with increased sympathetic tone, and metabolic adaptations.

					<li>"Insights From Invasive Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing of Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"<br>
						<i>Chest.</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.01.082">Joseph 2021</a>)
						<ul>
							<li>
							Editorial summary:
							This paper theorizes that exercise intolerance and orthostatic intolerance are due to
							peripheral neurovascular dysregulation. This is caused by either impaired venous
							return and/or impaired peripheral oxygen extraction. In some patients, small-fiber neuropathic
							dysregulation results in microvascular dilation, which causes shunting of oxygenated blood
							from capillary beds and reducing cardiac return.

				<h2>Hypotheses and Theories</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					This page will list published hypotheses and theories for ME/CFS and related conditions.
					It will only include the ideas with the most evidence and research behind them, rather than
					an exhaustive list of every conceivable hypothesis.

				<h4><u>For ME/CFS</u></h4>
				<ul class="level1">
					<li>"Pathomechanisms and possible interventions in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)"<br>
						<i>J Clin Invest.</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci150377">Fluge 2021</a>)
						<ul>
							<li>
							Editor's Summary: The authors suggest three steps underlie the initiation and maintenance of ME/CFS.
							First, an immune response after infection is a trigger for B cells/plasma cells and autoantibodies.
							Second, the autoantibodies target the vascular system and possibly GPCRs, which may affect endothelium or neurovascular control and autonomic small nerve fibers.
							This causes endothelial dysfunction in large and small arteries, impaired venous return and preload failure, and arteriovenous shunting, presumed to result in impaired autoregulation of blood flow and tissue hypoxia on exertion.
							Finally, compensatory efforts add to the clinical presentations with autonomic adaptations, often with increased sympathetic tone, and metabolic adaptations.

					<li>"Insights From Invasive Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing of Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"<br>
						<i>Chest.</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.01.082">Joseph 2021</a>)
						<ul>
							<li>
							Editor's Summary:
							This paper theorizes that exercise intolerance and orthostatic intolerance are due to
							peripheral neurovascular dysregulation. This is caused by either impaired venous
							return and/or impaired peripheral oxygen extraction. In some patients, small-fiber neuropathic
							dysregulation results in microvascular dilation, which causes shunting of oxygenated blood
							from capillary beds and reducing cardiac return. Additionally, the authors claim their
							findings are not consistent with deconditioning, and that their work
							"definitively eliminates" a deconditioning explanation for the symptoms of ME/CFS.

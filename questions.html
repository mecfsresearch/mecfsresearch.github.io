				<h2>Questions and Research Ideas</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					This page features some ideas for research.
				</p>

				<ul class="level1">
					<li>Pathogens in Children and Adolescents with ME/CFS:
						<p>
						Since viruses linked to ME/CFS, such as Epstein-Barr virus, have high
						rates of infection in adult population, studying infectivity rates in
						younger patients compared to age-matched controls might be more informative.
						</p>
						<p>
						Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) is the virus that causes chickenpox, with later
						reactivations causing shingles. Since the virus establishes latency in the
						autonomic and dorsal root ganglia, could it cause ME/CFS? See hypothesis paper
						<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2009.04.043">Shapiro 2009</a>. As a
						vaccine for VZV became available in the 1990s, studying	vaccinated persons to
						see if this changes the ME/CFS risk could help provide evidence
						to support or refute this hypothesis.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>Effect of anti-herpetics (e.g. valacyclovir/Valtrex, famciclovir/Favir) on risk of ME/CFS or Long COVID:<br>
						A study of persons taking valacyclovir (or related drugs) for HSV suppression
						to determine if this changes risk of Long COVID after COVID-19 illness, or ME/CFS
						generally.
					</li>
<!--
					<li>Effect of X drug on risk of ME/CFS or Long COVID:<br>
						Similar to above, but study people taking immune suppressants for rheumatic/autoimmune disease.
					</li>
-->
<!--
					<li>Investigation of Monocytes:<br>
						Why did monocyte counts decrease substantially in the placebo-controlled valacyclovir trial?
						Why are cerebrospinal fluid monocyte counts lower in ME/CFS than controls (NIH Walitt study - supplementary data)?
						Perhaps a short-duration (90-day) trial of antivirals in ME/CFS and another population (depression, MS, and/or healthy)
						while monitoring monocytes should be performed.
					</li>
-->
					<li>Small Fiber Neuropathy:<br>
						Identification of small fiber neuropathy in a significant number of ME/CFS patients raises several questions.
						One technique for identifying SFN is through measuring intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in skin punch biopsy samples.
						<ul class="level2">
							<li>What is the IEFND in the calf, distal thigh, proximal thigh, and arm in ME/CFS patients vs. normal controls?</li>
							<li>What is the thigh:calf IEFND ratio in ME/CFS patients vs. normal controls?</li>
							<li>What is the rate of SFN in ME/CFS versus MS, Sjogren's syndrome, etc.?</li>
							<li>Can SFN be identified in ME/CFS patients reliably? Can non-invasive tests be used?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

				<h2>Questions and Research Ideas</h2>
				<p class="passage">
					This page features some ideas for research.
				</p>

				<ul class="level1">
					<li>Pathogens in Children and Adolescents with ME/CFS:<br>
						Since viruses linked to ME/CFS, such as Epstein-Barr virus, have high
						rates of infection in adult population, studying infectivity rates in
						younger patients might be more informative.
					</li>

					<li>Effect of Valacyclovir (Valtrex) on risk of ME/CFS or Long COVID:<br>
						A study of persons taking valacyclovir (or related drugs) for HSV suppression
						to determine if this reduces risk of Long COVID after COVID-19 illness, or ME/CFS
						generally.
					</li>

					<li>Effect of X drug on risk of ME/CFS or Long COVID:<br>
						Similar to above, but study people taking immune suppressants for rheumatic/autoimmune disease.
					</li>

					<li>Investigation of Monocytes:<br>
						Why did monocyte counts decrease substantially in the placebo-controlled valacyclovir trial?
						Why are cerebrospinal fluid monocyte counts lower in ME/CFS than controls (NIH Walitt study - supplementary data)?
						Perhaps a short-duration (90-day) trial of antivirals in ME/CFS and another population (depression, MS, and/or healthy)
						while monitoring monocytes should be performed.
					</li>

					<li>Non-Length Dependent Small Fiber Neuropathy:<br>
						Diagnostic criteria for SFN are tuned for length-dependent SFN. It may be necessary to test
						patients and healthy controls for SFN by alternative methods. One method might be to check
						intraepidermal nerve fiber density on upper body sites rather than conventional sites on the lower body.
					</li>
				</ul>
